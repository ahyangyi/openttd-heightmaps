# Introduction
This repo contains a collection of heightmaps for use in [OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org/). They are probably also useful in other city-building games and transporation games.

The heightmaps were also submitted to [BaNaNaS](https://bananas.openttd.org/), the in-game content manager for open-source downloadable contents.
