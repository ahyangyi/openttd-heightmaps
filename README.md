# Introduction
This repo contains a collection of heightmaps for use in [OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org/). They are probably also useful in other city-building games and transporation games.

The heightmaps were also submitted to [BaNaNaS](https://bananas.openttd.org/), the in-game content manager for open-source downloadable contents.

# Curve Land
The curve land series center around the idea of long, snaking, interconnecting islands. This type of map seems to play radically different from other types of maps.

## Curve Land 1
Original version: 2048×2048.

Reproduced version: 8192×8192. (Using Apophysis with plugins)

## Curve Land 4
This is a new creation in 2023. I wanted a “curvy” map where you feel like you still have choices, so I placed the connections accordingly.

Resolution:

* (16k version) 16384×16384, but good at 2048×2048 and above.
* (2k version) 2048×2048, useable at 512×512 and above.

## Fracland 5
New creation in 2024. I realized that all my previous heightmaps were square-shaped, and there is a certain demand in long rectangular maps. Perhaps because that’s the way to make really long distance transportation to happen.

So I thought this combination of big, hilly islands and steep fjords would be fun. You can connect all the big islands without much terraforming, and you can really test the newly improved water pathfinding with these interesting waterways (and perhaps a few strategically placed canals).
