# Introduction
This repo contains a collection of heightmaps for use in [OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org/). They are probably also useful in other city-building games and transporation games.

The heightmaps were also submitted to [BaNaNaS](https://bananas.openttd.org/), the in-game content manager for open-source downloadable contents.

# Curve Land
The curve land series center around the idea of long, snaking, interconnecting islands. This type of map seems to play radically different from other types of maps.

Original version: 2048×2048.

Reproduced version: 8192×8192. (Using Apophysis with plugins)

## Curve Land 4
This is a new creation in 2023. I wanted a “curvy” map where you feel like you still have choices, so I placed the connections accordingly.

Resolution: 16384×16384, but good at 2048×2048 and above.
