# Introduction
This repo contains a collection of heightmaps for use in [OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org/). They are probably also useful in other city-building games and transporation games.

The heightmaps were also submitted to [BaNaNaS](https://bananas.openttd.org/), the in-game content manager for open-source downloadable contents.

# Curve Land
The curve land series center around the idea of long, snaking, interconnecting islands. This type of map seems to play radically different from other types of maps.

## Curve Land 3
The seed cannot be rendered by flam3. Hence, I can only produce a 8k version for now.
